# 9. Palindrome Number

- https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0: # Negative numbers are not palindromes
            return False

        if x != 0 and x % 10 == 0: # Non-zero numbers that end with 0 are not palindromes
            return False

        reversed_number = 0

        # Reverse the second half of x
        while x > reversed_number: 
            reversed_number = reversed_number * 10 + x % 10 # Take the digit from the back of x (x % 10) and put it infront of `reversed_number`
            x //= 10

        # First half == reversed second half 
        # // 10 to take into account odd-length numbers
        return x == reversed_number or x == reversed_number // 10
```

For a number `x` with $N$ digits:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$. Time taken to reverse the second half of the number
- Space complexity: $O(1)$. No extra space required.
