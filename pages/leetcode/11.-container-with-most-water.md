# 11. Container With Most Water

- https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/

## Solution

We have 2 pointers `p1` and `p2`, which define the container. We start with `p1 = 0`, and `p2 = len(height)`, which is the widest container. 

The area of the container would then be `(p2 - p1) * min(height[p1], height[p2])`. To proceed on, we remove the smaller one of the 2 lines from consideration. This is because the smaller of the 2 lines definitely will not support a higher water level (since the width goes down, we know the height has to increase to hold more water).
- For example, consider `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 5`, `heights[p1] = 3`, `heights[p2] = 5`. The area of the container would be `(5 - 0) * min(3, 5) = 15`. If we decide to keep the lower height wall, then the new area of the container would be `(5 - x) * min(3, x)`, where `x > 0`. And we can see that this is definitely smaller than the previous area. This is why we move the pointer to the lower height instead.
- In the case where `height[p1] == height[p2]`, it does not matter which one we move, because the next area obtained is always smaller.

```py
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0

        p1 = 0 # Start from the left
        p2 = len(height) - 1 # Start from the right

        while p1 < p2:
            result = max(result, (p2 - p1) * min(height[p1], height[p2])) # Update the max area

            if height[p1] < height[p2]: # Move the pointer with the lower height
                p1 += 1
            else:
                p2 -= 1

        return result
```

For an array `height` of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$. We will iterate through the entire `height` array.
- Space complexity: $O(1)$. No extra space required.
