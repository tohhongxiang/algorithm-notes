# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

- https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description

# Solution

We can use the two-pointer approach to solve this problem

1. Initialise a `slow` and `fast` pointer to start at `head`
2. Move `fast` `n` spaces ahead
3. If `fast` is `None`, this means that we want to remove the head node. We can just return `head.next`
4. Now, we move `slow` and `fast` until `fast` reaches the last element. `slow` will now be the `n - 1`th element
5. We connect the `n - 1`th element with the `n + 1`th element, thus removing the `n`th element
6. Return the original `head`

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        fast = slow = head

        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next # move fast to be n in front of slow

        if not fast:
            return head.next # if n == length of linked list, we remove the head

        # move fast to be the last element
        # now slow will be the n + 1th from the last element
        while fast.next: 
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next

        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space
