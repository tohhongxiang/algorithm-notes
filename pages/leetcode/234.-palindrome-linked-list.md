# 234. Palindrome Linked List

# Solution

## Part 1: $O(n)$ time and space complexity

1. Copy all the values from the linked list into an array
2. Starting from both ends, check if the values are equal. If they are not equal, we immediately know that the linked list is not a palindrome, and we can return `False`. If we go through the entire linked list and the values are all equal, we know that the linked list is a palindrome, and we can return `True`

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        values = []
        current = head
        while current is not None:
            values.append(current.val)
            current = current.next

        l = 0
        r = len(values) - 1
        while l < r:
            if values[l] != values[r]:
                return False

            l += 1
            r -= 1

        return True
```

This runs in $O(n)$ time (going through the whole linked list) and $O(n)$ space (copying all the values in the linked list into an array)

## Part 2: $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space complexity

Before starting, we define a function `reverse` which will reverse the linked list

1. Initialize a `middle` and an `end` variable, both initially starting at `head`
2. While `end is not None` and `end.next is not None`, we move `middle` by 1 node and `end` by 2 nodes. This way, when `end` reaches the end of the list, `middle` will be in the middle of the list
3. Reverse the list from `middle`
4. Starting from `head`, check if `head.val == middle.val`. If they are not equal, we immediately know that the linked list is not a palindrome, and we can return `False`. If we reach the end of the list, and all the values are equal, we know that the linked list is a palindrome, and we return `True`

```py
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head

        while curr is not None:
            nextNode = curr.next
            curr.next = prev

            prev = curr
            curr = nextNode

        return prev

    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        middle = end = head
        while end is not None and end.next is not None:
            middle = middle.next
            end = end.next.next

        middle = self.reverse(middle) # reverse
        while middle is not None:
            if head.val != middle.val:
                return False

            head = head.next
            middle = middle.next

        return True
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space.
