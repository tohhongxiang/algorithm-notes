# 238. Product of Array Except Self

- https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description

# Solution

1. Initialize `result = [1] * len(nums)` which will be our final result array, and `prefix = 1` to get the prefix product of numbers up to `i`
2. At each index `i`, `prefix` is currently the product of all numbers before `i`. Set `result[i] = prefix`, then increase `prefix` by `prefix *= nums[i]`
3. Now each item in the array is the product of all numbers before itself. We will now process the array in reverse to multiply each element by the product of all numbers **after** `i`
4. Initialize a `postfix = 1` for the postfix product of numbers from `i + 1` to the end of the array
5. Iterating from the back of the array, at each index `i`, `result[i] *= postfix`. This makes `result[i]` the product of all numbers before and after, but not including itself. Afterwards, increase `postfix` by `postfix *= nums[i]`

```py
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = [1] * len(nums)

        prefix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            result[i] = prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]

        postfix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            result[i] *= postfix
            postfix *= nums[i]

        return result
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(n)$ space
