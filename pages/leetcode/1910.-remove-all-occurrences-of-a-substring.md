# 1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring

- https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-occurrences-of-a-substring/description

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def removeOccurrences(self, s: str, part: str) -> str:
        result_stack = []
        target_length = len(part)
        target_end_char = part[-1]

        for current_char in s:
            result_stack.append(current_char)

            # Check if the top of the stack contains `part`
            if current_char == target_end_char and len(result_stack) >= target_length: 
                if "".join(result_stack[-target_length:]) == part: 
                    del result_stack[-target_length:] # Remove the top part of the stack

        return "".join(result_stack) # Join back the array and return
```

For a string `s` of length $N$ and a string `part` of length $M$:
- Time complexity: $O(M * N)$ to iterate through the entire `s`, and compare to `part` at every index of `s`.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$, `result_stack` will at worst contain the entire `s`.
