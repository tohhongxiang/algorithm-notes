# 2348. Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays

- https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-zero-filled-subarrays/description/

# Solution

We know that if we have a subarray of 0's of length `n`, it will contribute `n * (n - 1) / 2` arrays to the result. Hence, we can do the following:

1. Initialise a `continuousCount = 0` which represents the number of zero-filled subarrays at the current index. Initialise a `result = 0` which will be returned at the end
2. If we encounter a 0, we increase `continuousCount` by 1, and add this to the result. For the first 0, it will add 1 to the result. For the second continuous 0, it will add an additional 2 to the result, and so on.
3. If we encounter anything that is not 0, we reset `continuousCount = 0` and move on
4. Return `result`

```py
class Solution:
    def zeroFilledSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        continuousCount = 0
        result = 0

        for num in nums:
            if num == 0:
                continuousCount += 1
                result += continuousCount
            else:
                continuousCount = 0

        return result
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space
