- https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-form-a-target-string-given-a-dictionary/

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, words: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        # frequencies[i]: { [letter]: count } of all letters that occur at index[i] in each word
        frequencies = [defaultdict(int) for _ in range(len(words[0]))] 
        for i in range(len(words[0])):
            for word in words:
                frequencies[i][word[i]] += 1

        cache = {}
        def recurse(index_in_words, index_in_target):
            if index_in_target == len(target): # Reached the end of target, valid solution
                return 1

            if index_in_words == len(words[0]): # Reached the end of words, but have not built the entire target
                return 0

            if (index_in_words, index_in_target) in cache: # Cached result
                return cache[(index_in_words, index_in_target)]

            # First term: Skip the current index
            # Second term: Use the current index
            result = recurse(index_in_words + 1, index_in_target) + frequencies[index_in_words][target[index_in_target]] * recurse(index_in_words + 1, index_in_target + 1) 
            cache[(index_in_words, index_in_target)] = result % (10**9 + 7)

            return cache[(index_in_words, index_in_target)]

        return recurse(0, 0) 
```

For a `target` string of length $N$, and an array of $M$ `words` of length $S$:
- Time complexity: $O(M(S + N))$. Preprocessing takes $O(MS)$ time, while recursive calls take $O(MN)$ time. Hence, overall time complexity is $O(M(S + N))$.
- Space complexity: $O(M(S + N))$. Preprocessed `frequencies` takes $O(MS)$ space, while cache for recursive calls take $O(MN)$ space. Hence, overall space complexity is $O(M(S + N))$.

## Solution 2

```py
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, words: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        dp = [1] + [0] * len(target) # dp[i]: Number of ways to form the first i characters of target

        for i in range(len(words[0])):
            count = collections.Counter(word[i] for word in words)
            for j in range(len(target) - 1, -1, -1):
                dp[j + 1] += dp[j] * count[target[j]] % mod

        return dp[len(target)] % mod
```

- Time complexity: $O(S(M + N))$.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$
