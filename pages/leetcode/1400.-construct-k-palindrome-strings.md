# 1400. Construct K Palindrome Strings

- https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-k-palindrome-strings/description/

## Solution

1. If the number of characters in `s` is less than `k`, we definitely cannot make `k` palindromes with all the letters of `s`. Hence we return `False`.
2. We count the number of letters that occur an odd number of times in `s`. 
3. If there are more than `k` odd letters, this means that we have to create more than `k` palindromes (since each palindrome can only have at most 1 letter that occurs an odd number of times). In this case, we return `False`.
4. Else, we return `True`

```py
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        if len(s) < k: # If we have less letters than k, we cannot make k palindromes
            return False

        frequencies = Counter(s) # Keep track of the frequencies of letters occurring in s

        number_of_odd_frequencies = 0 # Count the number of letters which occurs an odd number of times
        for character, count in frequencies.items():
            if count % 2 == 1:
                number_of_odd_frequencies += 1

        return number_of_odd_frequencies <= k # If the number odd letters occurs <= k times, it is possible to create k palindromes
```

For a string `s` of $N$ characters,
- Time complexity: $O(N)$ to construct the frequencies dictionary.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$, which is the number of unique characters of `s`.
