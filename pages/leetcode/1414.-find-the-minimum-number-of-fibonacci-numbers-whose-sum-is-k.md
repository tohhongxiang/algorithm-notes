# 1414. Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K

- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-number-of-fibonacci-numbers-whose-sum-is-k/description/

# Solution

1. Get all the fibonacci numbers less than or equal to `k`
2. Greedily take from the largest fibonacci number to the smallest, and return the number of numbers required to sum up to `k`

```py
class Solution:
    def findMinFibonacciNumbers(self, k: int) -> int:
        # get fibonacci numbers < k
        nums = [1, 1]
        while nums[-1] < k:
            new_number = nums[-1] + nums[-2]

            if new_number > k:
                break

            nums.append(new_number)

        result = 0

        # start from the largest fibonacci number, keep subtracting until k == 0
        i = len(nums) - 1
        while i >= 0 and k >= 0:
            if k >= nums[i]: # can use this number, hence subtract from k and continue with next largest number
                k -= nums[i]
                i -= 1
                result += 1
            else: # cannot use this number, continue with next largest number
                i -= 1

        return result
```
