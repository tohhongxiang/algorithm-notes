## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def constructDistancedSequence(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        result = [0] * (2*n - 1)
        used = set()

        def dfs(current_index: int):
            if current_index >= len(result): # All previous spaces in the array were filled, we are done
                return True

            for number in range(n, 0, -1): # Try numbers from n - 1 in reverse order
                if number in used:
                    continue

                # For number > 1, we need to check that the next space (`result[current_index + number]`) is not filledj
                # If it is filled, then we cannot use our current number
                if number > 1 and (current_index + number >= len(result) or result[current_index + number] != 0):
                    continue

                # Try the current number as a candidate solution
                used.add(number)
                if number > 1:
                    result[current_index + number] = number
                result[current_index] = number

                # Need to get the next empty spot to continue dfs
                next_index = current_index + 1
                while next_index < len(result) and result[next_index] != 0:
                    next_index += 1

                # If it is a valid solution, we are done
                if dfs(next_index):
                    return True

                # Undo the candidate solution
                used.remove(number)
                if number > 1:
                    result[current_index + number] = 0
                result[current_index] = 0

            # We have found no valid solutions
            return False

        dfs(0)
        return result
```

For a value $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N!)$. Backtracking at most requires trying all combinations, which would be $O(N!)$
- Space complexity: $O(N)$
