# 2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency

- https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-subarray-with-at-most-k-frequency/description

# Solution

We can use a 2 pointer approach. 

1. We have 2 pointers `l` and `r`, and a dictionary `counter` to keep track of the frequency of elements
2. Everytime we increase `r`, we add the new element to `counter`
3. If `counter[nums[r]] > k`, we need to shrink the array. We move `l` forwards, until `counter[nums[r]] <= k`
4. The length of the array would be `r - l + 1`. We set `result = max(result, r - l + 1)` to keep track of the longest array we have seen

```py
class Solution:
    def maxSubarrayLength(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        l = 0

        counter = collections.defaultdict(int)

        for r in range(len(nums)):
            counter[nums[r]] += 1
            
            while counter[nums[r]] > k:
                counter[nums[l]] -= 1
                l += 1

            result = max(result, r - l + 1)
        
        return result
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(n)$ space
