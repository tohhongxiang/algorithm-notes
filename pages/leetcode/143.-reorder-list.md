# 143. Reorder List

- https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description

# Solution

1. We will have 2 pointers: `slow` and `fast`. `slow` will increment by 1, while `fast` increments by 2. Hence, at the end of the list, `slow` will be in the middle of the list.
2. Now, we reverse the second half of the list, and disconnect the second half from the first half. So now, we have 2 lists: `head1: L0 -> L1 -> ... -> L(n / 2)` and `head2: L(n) -> L(n - 1) -> ... -> L(n / 2 + 1)`. 

    For each node, we first keep track of the next node for `head1` using `nextNode = head1.next`. We first point `head1.next = head2`. We now set `head1 = head2` and `head2 = nextNode` so that we can repeat this process until we reach the end of the list

```py
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """

        if not head:
            return

        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        prev, curr = None, slow.next
        while curr:
            nextNode = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nextNode

        slow.next = None

        head1, head2 = head, prev
        while head2:
            nextNode = head1.next
            head1.next = head2

            head1 = head2
            head2 = nextNode
