# 2864. Maximum Odd Binary Number

- https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-odd-binary-number/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-01

# Solution

Procedure:
1. Count the number of 1's and 0's appearing in the string
2. For a binary number to be odd, there must be a 1 in the last place. For a string with `x` ones and `y` zeros, we can construct the biggest odd binary number by placing `x - 1` ones, followed by `y` zeroes, and a final one at the end

```py
class Solution:
    def maximumOddBinaryNumber(self, s: str) -> str:
        count = collections.Counter(s)

        return "1" * (count["1"] - 1) + "0" * count["0"] + "1"
```

For `n = len(s)`:
- $O(n)$ time to go through the entire string and count the frequencies
- $O(n)$ space to create the new `result`
