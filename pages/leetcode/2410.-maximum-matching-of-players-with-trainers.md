# 2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers

- https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/description

# Solution

Key insight: We want to greedily match players and trainers together. We try to match the weakest player with the weakest valid trainer.

1. Sort the `players` and `trainers` by their abilities
2. We keep track of the number of players and trainers we can match in `result`, and 2 pointers:
    1. `p_player` represents the current player we are trying to match
    2. `p_trainer` represents the current trainer we are trying to match
3. While we still have players and trainers to match:
    1. If the current player's ability is less than or equal to the current trainer's ability, it is a match. Increment `result`, and go to the next player and trainer
    2. If not, we go to the next trainer
4. Once done, we return the `result`

```py
class Solution:
    def matchPlayersAndTrainers(self, players: List[int], trainers: List[int]) -> int:
        players.sort()
        trainers.sort()

        result = 0
        p_player = 0
        p_trainer = 0

        while p_player < len(players) and p_trainer < len(trainers):
            if players[p_player] <= trainers[p_trainer]:
                result += 1
                p_player += 1
            
            p_trainer += 1

        return result
```

For $N$ players and $M$ trainers:
- Time complexity: $O(M \log M + N \log N)$. It takes $O(M \log M + N \log N)$ to sort the arrays, and $O(M + N)$ to go through each of the arrays
- Space complexity: $O(1)$ (Would be $O(\log M + \log N)$ if you count the additional space required to sort the array)
