# 2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower

- https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower/description

## Solution

### 1. Recursive with cache

```py
class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        cache = {}

        def solve(i):
            if i >= len(questions):
                return 0

            if i in cache:
                return cache[i]

            result = max(questions[i][0] + solve(i + 1 + questions[i][1]), solve(i + 1))
            cache[i] = result
            return result

        return solve(0)
```

For an array `questions` of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$ to go through the whole array.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$ for storing results in `cache`.

### 2. Iterative DP

```py
class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        result = [0] * (len(questions) + 1)

        for i in range(len(questions) - 1, -1, -1):
            points, skip = questions[i]
            result[i] = max(points + result[min(skip + i + 1, len(questions))], result[i + 1])

        return result[0]
```

For an array `questions` of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$ to go through the whole array.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$ for storing the `result` array.
