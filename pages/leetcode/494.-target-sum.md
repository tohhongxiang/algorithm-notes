1. We initialize `dp`, a dictionary where the key is the `current_sum`, and the value is the number of ways to reach `current_sum`
2. We set `dp[0] = 1`. There is 1 way for 0 elements to reach a sum of 0.
3. For each number in `nums`:
   1. We initialize the next row (`next_dp`) to store the number of ways to reach `current_sum` after using the next element.
   2. We loop through all the key-value pairs in `dp`. (Recall that the key is the `current_sum`, and the value is the number of ways to reach `current_sum`)
   3. For each `current_sum`-`count` pair in `dp`:
      1. If we choose to add the current element (`nums[i]`), then the new `current_sum` would be `current_sum + nums[i]`. We want to update `next_dp[current_sum + nums[i]]` and add `count`.
      2. Similarly, if we choose to subtract the current element, then we should be updating `next_dp[current_sum - nums[i]]`
   4. After we iterate through the entire `dp` dictionary, we set `dp = next_dp` and continue the loop
4. We want to return the final `dp[target]` as our answer.

```py
class Solution:
    def findTargetSumWays(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        dp = defaultdict(int) # { [current_sum]: number_of_ways_to_reach_sum }
        
        dp[0] = 1 # (0 sum) -> 1 way

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            next_dp = defaultdict(int) # next row
            for current_sum, count in dp.items():
                next_dp[current_sum + nums[i]] += count
                next_dp[current_sum - nums[i]] += count

            dp = next_dp

        return dp[target]
```

For a list of $N$ `nums`, and $M$ unique sums of `nums`:
- Time complexity: $O(MN)$. For each of the $N$ elements in `nums`, we loop through `dp`, which has at most $M$ keys.
- Space complexity: $O(M)$. `dp` is a dictionary with at most $M$ keys.
