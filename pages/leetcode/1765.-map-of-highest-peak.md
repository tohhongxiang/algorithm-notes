## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def highestPeak(self, isWater: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        ROWS, COLS = len(isWater), len(isWater[0])

        queue = deque()
        result = [[-1] * COLS for _ in range(ROWS)] # Final matrix to return

        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if isWater[r][c]: # For all water cells
                    queue.append((r, c)) # Append to BFS queue
                    result[r][c] = 0 # Set height to 0

        while len(queue) > 0: # BFS
            r, c = queue.popleft() # Get current element we are looking at
            current_height = result[r][c] # Extract current height of current element

            neighbors = [[r + 1, c], [r - 1, c], [r, c + 1], [r, c - 1]]
            for nr, nc in neighbors: # For each neighbor
                if nr < 0 or nc < 0 or nr == ROWS or nc == COLS or result[nr][nc] != -1: # If out of bounds or visited, skip
                    continue

                queue.append((nr, nc)) # Append neighbor to queue
                result[nr][nc] = current_height + 1 # Set height to +1 of previous height

        return result
```

For an $M$ by $N$ grid `isWater`:
- Time complexity: $O(MN)$. We go through all cells in `isWater`.
- Space complexity: $O(MN)$. `result` is $O(MN)$.
