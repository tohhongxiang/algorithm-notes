# 515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row

- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-largest-value-in-each-tree-row/

## Solution

1. Initialize `result` as an empty array, which will be the final result to return.
2. If `root` is `None`, then `root` is an empty tree, and we can immediately return.
3. Initialize a `queue` with `root` as the initial node.
4. While we still have nodes to process (`len(queue) > 0`):
   1. All elements in the queue at this point belong to the same level. Get the max value from all the nodes, and append it to `result`.
   2. For all nodes currently in the queue:
      1. Pop the current node.
      2. Push the left child in (if it exists).
      3. Push the right child in (if it exists).
5. Return `result`.

```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def largestValues(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        result = []

        if root is None: # Empty tree, nothing to do
            return result

        # Standard BFS
        queue = deque([root])
        while len(queue) > 0:
            result.append(max(node.val for node in queue)) # Get the max of the current level, and update result

            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                currentNode = queue.popleft()

                if currentNode.left:
                    queue.append(currentNode.left)

                if currentNode.right:
                    queue.append(currentNode.right)

        return result
```

For a tree with $N$ elements:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$. BFS will take $O(N)$ time, and finding the maximum of each level will take at most $O(N)$ time as well.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$. `queue` will have at most $N/2$ elements (for a full binary tree).
