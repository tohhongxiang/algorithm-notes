- https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/description/

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        N = len(edges)

        # Union Find
        par = [i for i in range(N + 1)] # par[i]: Parent of node i
        rank = [1] * (N + 1) # rank[i]: Rank of node i

        def find(n):
            if n != par[n]: # Path compression, set parent of current node to root of the group
                par[n] = find(par[n])

            return par[n]

        def union(n1, n2):
            p1, p2 = find(n1), find(n2) # Find parents of both nodes
            if p1 == p2: # If both nodes have the same parent, we have a cycle
                return False

            # Set the root as the larger group, and update the ranks
            if rank[p1] > rank[p2]:
                par[p2] = p1
                rank[p1] += rank[p2]
            else:
                par[p1] = p2
                rank[p2] += rank[p1]

            return True

        for n1, n2 in edges:
            if not union(n1, n2):
                return [n1, n2]

        return [-1, -1]
```

For a graph of $N$ nodes, there will be $N$ edges (A tree will have $N - 1$ edges, and in this question, we have an additional edge).
- Time complexity: $O(N \alpha^{-1}(N))$, where $\alpha^{-1}(N)$ is the [inverse Ackermann function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function#Inverse). We go through all `edges`, and each union-find operation is  $\alpha^{-1}(N)$. Refer to [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6342967/why-is-the-ackermann-function-related-to-the-amortized-complexity-of-union-find) for the explanation of the time complexity of union-find.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$. `par` and `rank` both take $O(N)$ space.
