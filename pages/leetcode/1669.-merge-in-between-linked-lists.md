# 1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists

- https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-in-between-linked-lists/description

# Solution

1. Initialize `p1` at the head, and move `p1` `a - 1` nodes ahead (the node just before the first node to be removed)
2. Initialize `p2` at `p1` and move `p1` `b - a + 2` nodes ahead (the node just after the last node to be removed). Since `p1` was at the `a - 1`th node, we have to move `b - a + 2` nodes ahead so that `p2` ends up at the `b + 1`th node
3. Connect `p1` to the head of the second list
4. Connect the tail of the second list to `p2`. To get the tail of the second list, we just keep going forward until the next node is `None`
5. Return the resultant list

```py
class Solution:
    def mergeInBetween(self, list1: ListNode, a: int, b: int, list2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        p1 = list1
        for i in range(a - 1):
            p1 = p1.next

        p2 = p1
        for i in range(b - a + 2):
            p2 = p2.next

        p1.next = list2
        list2Tail = list2
        while list2Tail.next is not None:
            list2Tail = list2Tail.next

        list2Tail.next = p2

        return list1
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space
