# 41. First Missing Positive

- https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/description

# Solution

Initially, we can easily solve this with $O(n)$ time and memory.

Notice how the first positive number that is missing will always be in the range of `1` to `len(nums) + 1`. In the best case, all numbers in the array are very big, and `1` is missing. In the worst case, `nums` consists of all numbers from `1` to `len(nums)`, hence the first missing positive would be `len(nums) + 1`.

Hence, the procedure is as follows:
1. Create a set from `nums` to remove all duplicates
2. We loop from `1` to `len(nums)`, and check if `i` is in the set (which can be done in $O(1)$ time). If it is not in the set, we can immediately return. If all numbers exist in the set, we know the next number `len(nums) + 1` is not in the set. 

```py
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = set(nums)
        for i in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
            if i not in nums:
                return i

        return len(nums) + 1
```

To improve the memory complexity to $O(1)$, we can modify the input array to mark whether the number exists in the array. Check [NeetcodeIO's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g78yfzMlao) for more detailed explanation.

We will need to preprocess the array first to make our lives easier. We take note of the following:

For each number `num` that occurs in the array:
- If `num < 1`, we can ignore it because it will not affect the answer for the smallest positive number
- If `1 <= num <= len(nums)`, we can mark the specific index `num - 1` to show that the number has appeared in the array. This is done by setting `nums[num - 1]` to a negative value
- If `num > len(nums)`, it will not affect the answer as well

The key idea is: When we see `val` in the array, we want to set `nums[val - 1]` to be a negative number. Since we are going through the array and changing it at the same time, we can simply use `val = abs(val)` to extract its original value. However, an edge case we need to handle is if `val < 0` initially.

1. If `val < 0`, we set `val = 0`. We do this because later when we are marking the array, values can be negative as well, and we do not want to mixup the values.
2. If `1 <= val`, we leave it as it is

Our preprocessing is complete. Now our array contains values between `[0, infinity]`. We now loop through each number in `nums`, and check
- We extract its original value by using `val = abs(nums[i])`
- We can skip any `val < 1` or `val > len(nums)` since it does not affect our answer
- Otherwise, we modify `nums[val - 1]`
  - If `nums[val - 1] > 0`, we turn it negative by using `nums[val - 1] *= -1`
  - If `nums[val - 1] < 0`, it means we have already seen this number, and can ignore it
  - If `nums[val - 1] == 0`, it means this used to be a negative number or `0`. We must be careful, because `0 * -1 = 0`, which is not negative, and we would have been unsuccessful in marking that `val` occurred in the array. Hence, we set `nums[val - 1] = -1 * (len(nums) + 1)`. This way, we can ensure that `val` was successfully flagged as seen, and that if we visit `nums[val - 1]` in the future, we will not mark any of the existing values in the array as negative.

Finally, we can loop through the array again
- For each number from `1` to `len(nums)`
- If `nums[i - 1] >= 0`, we know we have not seen this number, and can return this number immediately
- If we go through the whole loop, and we have seen all the numbers, then we know the next missing positive number is `len(nums) + 1`

Altogether, the code is as follows:

```py
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # mark all negative nodes as zero
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] < 0:
                nums[i] = 0
        
        # mark numbers that have been seen
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            val = abs(nums[i]) # extract the original value
            if 1 <= val <= len(nums):
                # if we have not seen this number, mark it as seen
                if nums[val - 1] > 0: 
                    nums[val - 1] *= -1 
                # if this number is zero, set it to a special negative value
                elif nums[val - 1] == 0:
                    nums[val - 1] = -1 * (len(nums) + 1)

        # check all numbers again, and return the first number not seen
        for i in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
            if nums[i - 1] >= 0:
                return i

        # all previous numbers are seen, return the next smallest positive
        return len(nums) + 1
```

This runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space
