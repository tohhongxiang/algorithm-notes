```py
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        directions = { 1: [0, 1], 2: [0, -1], 3: [1, 0], 4: [-1, 0]} # Map direction numbers to the actual change in coordinates
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        q = deque([(0, 0, 0)]) # row, col, cost
        min_cost = { (0, 0): 0 } # (row, col): min_cost

        while q:
            row, col, cost = q.popleft()
            if (row, col) == (ROWS - 1, COLS - 1): # Reached target destination
                return cost

            for direction in directions:
                delta_row, delta_col = directions[direction]
                neighbor_row, neighbor_col = row + delta_row, col + delta_col
                neighbor_cost = cost if direction == grid[row][col] else cost + 1

                if neighbor_row < 0 or neighbor_col < 0 or neighbor_row == ROWS or neighbor_col == COLS: # Out of bounds
                    continue

                if neighbor_cost >= min_cost.get((neighbor_row, neighbor_col), float('inf')): # If cost is higher, ignore this path
                    continue

                min_cost[(neighbor_row, neighbor_col)] = neighbor_cost

                if direction == grid[row][col]:
                    q.appendleft((neighbor_row, neighbor_col, neighbor_cost)) # No change in direction, give it priority because it has lower cost
                else:
                    q.append((neighbor_row, neighbor_col, neighbor_cost)) # Change current cell direction, put at the back of the queue because higher cost
        
        return -1 # We will never reach here
```

For an $M$ by $N$ grid:
- Time complexity: $O(MN)$, go through all cells in the grid.
- Space complexity: $O(MN)$. `q` has at most $MN$ elements (1 per cell in the grid), `min_cost` has at most $MN$ elements (1 per cell in the grid).
