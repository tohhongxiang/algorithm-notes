# 791. Custom Sort String

- https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/description

# Solution

The simple one-liner solution is to use python's built-in `sort`

```py
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        return "".join(sorted(s, key=lambda x: order.find(x)))
```

Note that for `list.sort` and `sorted`, `key` is called on each list element `prior` to making comparisons. Hence, for a string `order` of length `m`, and a string `s` of length `n`, running the `key` function would take $O(mn)$, and sorting would be $O(n \log n)$. Hence the overall time complexity would be $O(mn + n \log n)$. This solution also takes $O(n)$ space to create a copy of the string `s`

The longer solution:

1. Count the frequency of each letter occurring in `s`
2. Initialise an empty string `result`, used to build up the final sorted string
3. Go through each character in `order`. For each character in `order`, we add it to `result`, along with the frequency of that particular character occurring within `s`
4. Go through all characters in `s`. For each character in `s` that did not appear in `order`, append it to the end of `result`

```py
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        char_counts = { char: 0 for char in order } # keys are characters that appear in `order`

        # count the frequency of each character in `s` that also appears in `order`
        for char in s:
            if char in char_counts:
                char_counts[char] += 1

        result = ""
        for char in order: # go through each character in `order`
            result += char * char_counts[char]

        # add remaining characters in `s` which are not in `order`
        for char in s:
            if char not in order:
                result += char

        return result
```

This takes $O(m + n)$ time (to go through both `order` and `s`) and $O(n)$ space (`char_counts` and `result` each take $O(n)$ space)
