```py
class Solution:
    def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        meetings.sort() # Sort by start times

        available = [i for i in range(n)] 
        used = [] # (end_time, room_number)
        count = [0] * n

        for start, end in meetings:
            # Finish all meetings that ended earlier than the current meeting
            while used and start >= used[0][0]:
                _, room = heapq.heappop(used)
                heapq.heappush(available, room)

            # No room available
            if not available:
                end_time, room = heapq.heappop(used) # Get the earliest ending meeting
                end = end_time + (end - start) # Find end time of delayed meeting
                heapq.heappush(available, room) # At the new end time, this is the available room

            # Room is available
            room = heapq.heappop(available) # Get the lowest number available room
            heapq.heappush(used, (end, room)) # Update its usage
            count[room] += 1 # Update count of meetings in that room

        return count.index(max(count)) # smallest meeting room with the largest count
```

For $M$ meetings and $N$ rooms:
- Time complexity: $O(M \log M + M \log N)$. Sorting `meetings` takes $O(M \log M)$, and we loop through all meetings ($O(M)$), and push/pop from the min-heaps which contain the meeting rooms ($O(\log N)$)
- Space complexity: $O(N)$. `available`, `used` and `count` each take $O(N)$ space to store all the meeting rooms.
