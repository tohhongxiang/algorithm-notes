class Solution:
    def wordSubsets(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        count2 = defaultdict(int) # Keep track of the counts of each letter occurring in words in words2
        for word in words2:
            count_word = Counter(word) # Create a counter of the counts of each letter in the current word
            for character, count in count_word.items(): # Merge the current word's count with the overall count
                count2[character] = max(count2[character], count) # If the character is the same, keep the maximum count

        result = []
        for word in words1: # For each word in w1
            count_word = Counter(word) # Count the frequency of each letter occurring
            is_universal = True # Flag to check whether to add word to final result

            for character, count in count2.items(): # Its okay if characters in w1 do not appear in the merged w2, but every character in w2 must appear in w1. That is why we loop through `count2` rather that `count_word`
                if count_word[character] < count: # If any word in words2 has a character frequency less than the current word, then there is some word in words2 that is not a subset of the current word in words1
                    is_universal = False # The word cannot be universal
                    break

            if is_universal: # Word passes the universal check
                result.append(word) # Add to result

        return result
```

For a list of $N_1$ words in `words1` of length $L_1$, and a list of $N_2$ words in `words2` of length $L_2$:
- Time complexity: $O(N_2 L_2 + N_1 L_2)$. In the first loop, we go through each word in `words2` ($O(N_2)$), and for each word, we loop through the characters in that word ($O(L_2)$). In the second loop, we go through each word in `words1` ($O(N_1)$), and we loop through the entire merged dictionary of `words2`.
- Space complexity: $O(N_2 L_2 + L_1)$. `count2` has at most $O(N_2 L_2)$ entries (which caps out at $26$, since `words1` and `words2` consist of only lowercase english words), while `count1` has at most $O(L_2)$ entries.
