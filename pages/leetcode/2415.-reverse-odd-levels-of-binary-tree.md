# 2415. Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree

- https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-odd-levels-of-binary-tree/

## Solution

1. Initialize `queue` to keep track of nodes to process in the tree, which will contain the initial `root` of the tree. Initialize `level = 0` to keep track of the level we are at.
2. While `queue` is not empty:
   1. If the current level is odd (`level % 2 == 1`):
      1. We initialize 2 pointers - `left` at the beginning of the queue, and `right` at the end of the queue. This will help keep track of which values to swap. Note: When we reach this part of the code, all the nodes in the `queue` are from the same level.
      2. While our left pointer is before our right pointer:
         1. Swap the 2 values of the nodes pointed by `left` and `right`.
         2. Increase `left` by 1, and decrease `right` by 1.
   2. After we are done swapping values, or if the current level is even, we proceed with normal BFS.
   3. Take the number of nodes currently in the queue, and loop through these nodes:
      1. For each node, pop it out from the `queue`.
      2. If the node has a `left` child, push it to the back of the queue.
      3. If the node has a `right` child, push it to the back of the queue.
3. Return the original `root`.

```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def reverseOddLevels(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        queue = deque([root])
        level = 0

        while len(queue) > 0:
            if level % 2 == 1:
                left = 0
                right = len(queue) - 1

                while left < right:
                    queue[left].val, queue[right].val = queue[right].val, queue[left].val
                    left += 1
                    right -= 1

            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                current = queue.popleft()

                if current.left:
                    queue.append(current.left)
                    
                if current.right:
                    queue.append(current.right)

            level += 1

        return root
```

For a tree with $N$ nodes:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$. We iterate through each node in the tree once.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$. The maximum size of the queue would be $N / 2$ (The last layer of the binary tree)
