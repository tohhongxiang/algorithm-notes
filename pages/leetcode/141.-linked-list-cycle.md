# 141. Linked List Cycle

- https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description

# Solution

We can use [Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floyds-cycle-finding-algorithm) (AKA Tortoise-Hare Algorithm)

- We have 2 pointers `slow` and `fast`
- Every iteration, we move `slow` 1 forward, and move `fast` 2 forward
- If `slow == fast`, we have a cycle
- If `fast` reaches the end of the list, we are done

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        if head is None: # handle empty list
            return False

        # initialise slow and fast pointers
        slow = head
        fast = head.next

        # while fast pointer has not reached the end of the list
        # also need to ensure fast.next is not None, so that we do not get a NoneType error
        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            # fast caught up with slow
            if slow == fast:
                return True

        # reached end of list without any cycle
        return False
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space
