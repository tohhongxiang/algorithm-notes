```py
class Solution:
    def checkIfPrerequisite(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:
        # Create adjacency list for our courses and their prerequisites
        # course1 -> course2: course2 has to be taken before course1
        adjList = defaultdict(list)
        for prerequisite, course in prerequisites:
            adjList[course].append(prerequisite)

        # Get all indirect prerequisites of every course
        prerequisiteMap = {} # course -> set of indirect prerequisites
        def dfs(course):
            if course not in prerequisiteMap: # If we have not visited this course yet
                prerequisiteMap[course] = set() # Create the new set
                for prerequisite in adjList[course]: # For each prerequisite of the current course
                    prerequisiteMap[course] |= dfs(prerequisite) # Add all the indirect prerequisites as well

                prerequisiteMap[course].add(course) # Add the course itself

            return prerequisiteMap[course] # Return all the requisites of the current course

        
        for course in range(numCourses): # Actually run the DFS for all the courses
            dfs(course)

        result = []
        for u, v in queries:
            result.append(u in prerequisiteMap[v]) # Get results for each query

        return result

```

For $N$ courses, and $Q$ queries:
- Time complexity: $O(N^3 + Q)$. The time complexity is $O(N (E + N) + Q)$, where $E$ is the number of edges in the graph. In the worst case, $E = O(N^2)$ (A fully connected graph), hence the overall time complexity is $O(N (E + N) + Q) = O(N (N^2 + N) + Q) = O(N^3 + Q)$.
- Space complexity: $O(N^2)$ for the `adjList` and the `prerequisiteMap`, where each course has $O(N)$ prerequisites.
