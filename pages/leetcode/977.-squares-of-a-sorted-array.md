# Squares of a Sorted Array

# Solution

Process: We know that either the left-most or the right-most element in the array will give the largest number, moving towards the center. Hence we can use the two-pointer approach.

1. Initialise a `left` pointer at the start of the array, and a `right` pointer at the end of the array
2. We loop while `left <= right`
   1. If `abs(nums[right]) < ans(nums[left])`, then we know that `nums[right] ** 2 > nums[left] ** 2`. Hence, we will add the square of the right element to the array, and decrease the right pointer by 1
   2. Otherwise, we will add the square of the left element to the array, and increase the left pointer by 1
3. Now we have a non-increasing array (largest number in front), since we added the largest number first. We require a non-decreasing array. Hence, we reverse the result and return it.

```py
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        result = []

        while left <= right:
            if abs(nums[left]) < abs(nums[right]):
                result.append(nums[right] * nums[right])
                right -= 1
            else:
                result.append(nums[left] * nums[left])
                left += 1

        return result[::-1]
```

This solution runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(n)$ space.
