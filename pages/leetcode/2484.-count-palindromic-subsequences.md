                            # We can see that there are `digit_counts[0]` occurrences of "02"

For a string `s` of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$. Constructing `prefixes` and `suffixes` takes $O(100N) = O(N)$ time, and the final loop takes $O(N)$ time as well.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$. `prefixes` and `suffixes` each take $O(100N) = O(N)$ space.
