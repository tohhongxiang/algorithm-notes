# 1352. Product of the Last K Numbers

- https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-the-last-k-numbers/description

## Solution

```py
class ProductOfNumbers:
    def __init__(self):
        self.size = 0 # The number of non-zero numbers added consecutively
        self.products = [1]
        

    def add(self, num: int) -> None:
        # If we are adding a 0, we know that any future calls to `getProduct` will just return 0, so we restart the array
        if num == 0: 
            self.size = 0
            self.products = [1]
        else: # If not, we track the product of all the previous non-zero numbers we have added
            self.size += 1
            self.products.append(self.products[-1] * num)
        

    def getProduct(self, k: int) -> int:
        if k > self.size: # If we will multiply by a 0
            return 0

        return self.products[-1] // self.products[-1 - k] # Product of all previous numbers / product of the first len(arr) - k numbers
```

- Space complexity: $O(N)$ to add $N$ numbers
- Time complexity: $O(1)$ for both `add` and `getProduct`, since we are not iterating through the array
