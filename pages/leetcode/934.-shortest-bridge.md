# 934. Shortest Bridge

- https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-bridge/description/

# Solution

Key concepts:
- DFS to find the first island
- We modify the grid (marking each visited cell with a 2) to ensure we do not re-process visited cells
- We perform BFS after we find the first island to find the shortest distance from the first to the second island
- All cells that belong to the first island are added to a queue which is used for BFS

Procedure:
1. Loop through the grid until we find the first 1
2. Perform DFS from the first 1, until we find the entire first island. Add each cell that belongs to the first island in to a queue. Once this is complete, we stop performing DFS
3. Perform BFS starting with all the cells from the first island. Once we find the second island (a cell marked `1`), we return the required distance

For a `m` by `n` grid
- Runs in $O(mn)$ time if we go through the entire grid
- Runs in $O(mn)$ space if we store the entire grid in the queue
