# 2661. First Completely Painted Row or Column

- https://leetcode.com/problems/first-completely-painted-row-or-column/description/

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def firstCompleteIndex(self, arr: List[int], mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS, COLS = len(mat), len(mat[0])

        coordinate_map = {}
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                coordinate_map[mat[r][c]] = (r, c) # For each number, map it to its coordinate

        row_count = [0] * ROWS # Keep track of painted cells in each row
        col_count = [0] * COLS # Keep track of painted cells in each column
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            r, c = coordinate_map[arr[i]] # Get coordinate of current element in `mat`

            # Increment corresponding row and column count
            row_count[r] += 1 
            col_count[c] += 1

            # When the row/column is fully painted, return the index
            if row_count[r] == COLS or col_count[c] == ROWS:
                return i

        # Never reached
        return -1
```

For an $M$ by $N$ matrix `mat`:
- Time complexity: $O(MN)$, to go through each cell of `mat`.
- Space complexity: $O(MN)$, storing each coordinate in `coordinate_map`.
