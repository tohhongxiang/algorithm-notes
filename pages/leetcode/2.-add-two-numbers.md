# 2. Add Two Numbers

- https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

## Solution

1. We initialize `result` using a dummy node with a value of `0`, which holds the resulting linked list. Later when returning, we will not return this first node as it is not part of the result.
2. We initialize `tail` which keeps track of the last node in `result`.
3. We initialize `carry = 0` which stores the carry value during addition.
4. While we still have digits to process in either `l1` or `l2`, or if the carry is not `0`:
   1. We check if there is actually a digit in `l1` to process. If there is, we use `l1.val`. If not, we use `0`.
   2. We also check if there is a digit in `l2` to process. If there is, we use `l2.val`. If not, we use `0`.
   3. We add the 2 digits together, and add the carry as well from the previous iteration. We store it in `total`.
   4. We get the resultant digit using `total % 10`, and the carry will be updated to `total // 10` (If `total > 10`, `carry == 1`. Else `carry == 0`).
   5. We create a new node with the calculated digit, and attach the new node to `tail.next`
   6. We move forward the `tail` pointer to the newly created node.
   7. We update `l1` and `l2` pointers to the next digit, else we keep it as `None` if the digits are all processed.
5. After the loop, we skip the initial created dummy node and return the resulting list.

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        result = ListNode(val=0, next=None) # Start by creating a dummy node
        tail = result # Keeps track of the last node in `result`
        carry = 0 # Keeps track of the carry

        while l1 is not None or l2 is not None or carry != 0:
            digit1 = l1.val if l1 is not None else 0
            digit2 = l2.val if l2 is not None else 0

            total = digit1 + digit2 + carry
            digit = total % 10
            carry = total // 10

            tail.next = ListNode(val=digit, next=None)
            tail = tail.next

            l1 = l1.next if l1 is not None else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 is not None else None

        return result.next # NOTE: You could have to manually delete the initial `result` node we created in the beginning
```

For 2 numbers of length $M$ and $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(\max(M, N))$. The algorithm iterates at most $\max(M, N)$ times.
- Space complexity: $O(\max(M, N))$. The answer is at most $\max(M, N) + 1$ digits long.
