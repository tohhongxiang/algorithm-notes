# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

- https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description

# Solution

Use Floyd's cycle finding algorithm to find the number. The core idea is that each number points to the index in the array, basically converting the array into a graph.

1. We set a `slow = fast = nums[0]` as pointers. `fast` moves twice as fast as `slow`
2. We increment `slow = nums[slow]` and `fast = nums[nums[fast]]`. If `slow == fast`, then we know that a cycle exists, and we break
3. We now need to find where the cycle is. We set `slow = nums[0]`, and keep `fast` at its current position. Now, `while slow != fast`, we increment both `slow` and `fast` at the same rate. When `slow == fast`, we have reached that duplicate element, and we will return it

```py
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = fast = nums[0]

        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]

            if slow == fast:
                break

        slow = nums[0]
        while slow != fast:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[fast]

        return slow
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space.
