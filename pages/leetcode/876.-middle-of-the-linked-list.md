# 876. Middle of the Linked List

- https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description

# Solution

Procedure:
1. We initialise a `slow` and `fast` pointer which points to the head of the node
2. We move `slow` 1 node forward, and `fast` 2 nodes forward
3. We keep moving until `fast` is at the end of the list. At this point, `slow` will be in the middle of the list
4. Return `slow`

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow = head
        fast = head

        # also check fast.next to ensure no NoneType errors
        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        return slow
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space
