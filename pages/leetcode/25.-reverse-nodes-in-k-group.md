# Definition for singly-linked list.

#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def getKthNodeAfterCurrent(self, curr, k):
        while curr and k > 0:
            curr = curr.next
            k -= 1

        return curr

    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(-1, head)

            kth = self.getKthNodeAfterCurrent(group_previous, k)

            prev, curr = kth.next, group_previous.next

                prev = curr
                curr = temp

            # Restore links for the group we just reversed
            temp = group_previous.next

For further elaboration, this is an illustration of reversing a k-group of 3:

```

temp = curr.next;
(previous k-group) -> a -> b -> c -> (next k-group)
                      ^    ^         ^
                      curr temp      prev

curr.next = prev;
                      ┌───────>──────┐

                                ^    ^        
                                prev curr

                 └───────>──────┘

                                ^
