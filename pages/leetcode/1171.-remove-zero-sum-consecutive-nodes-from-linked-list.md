# 1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List

- https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-zero-sum-consecutive-nodes-from-linked-list/description

# Solution

1. Initialize `dummy`, a dummy node before the start of the list, in case the whole list has to be modified
2. Initialize `prefix_sum` which keeps track of the current prefix sum, and a hashmap `prefix_sum`, which keeps track of all the prefix sums we have seen before, and their corresponding ending node. The key is the prefix sum of all nodes up to this node, and the value is this corresponding node
3. Initialize `current` which starts at the head, and progress through the list until the end
4. While `current` has not reached the end of the list
   1. Update the prefix sum
   2. If we have not seen this prefix sum before, add it to the hashmap
   3. If we have seen this prefix sum before, it means that some subsequence between the start and current node sums up to zero. This subsequence starts from `prefix_sums[prefix_sum]` until `current`. We will have to delete by updating the hashmap, and then setting the `next` of the node before to the current node's next
      1. Start from `prefix_sums[prefix_sum].next`, and keep track of a temporary sum during deleting using `temp_sum = prefix_sum + to_delete.val`
      2. While we have not reached the current node, we delete the `temp_sum` key from the hashmap, and advance `to_delete` to `to_delete.next`. At the same time, update `temp_sum += to_delete.val`
   4. After deleting (or not deleting), we advance `current` to `current.next`

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeZeroSumSublists(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # initialize dummy node in case entire list needs to be modified
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head

        # keep track of current prefix sum and all seen prefix sums
        prefix_sum = 0
        prefix_sums = { 0: dummy } # key: sum of all nodes before this node, value: this node
        
        current = head # start looking from head
        while current is not None:
            prefix_sum += current.val # update prefix sum

            if prefix_sum not in prefix_sums: # if we have not seen this sum before, just update hash map
                prefix_sums[prefix_sum] = current 
            else: # if we have seen this sum before, there exists some subsequence that adds to 0
                to_delete = prefix_sums[prefix_sum].next # flag the node to delete
                temp_sum = prefix_sum + to_delete.val # keep track of the current sum during deleting

                # delete all prefix sums from the hashmap that correspond to nodes before the current node
                while to_delete != current: # while we have not reached the current node
                    del prefix_sums[temp_sum] # delete the corresponding node form hashmap
                    to_delete = to_delete.next # find the next node
                    temp_sum += to_delete.val # update the current sum during deleting

                # delete nodes in between by setting the next directly
                prefix_sums[prefix_sum].next = current.next

            # move forward
            current = current.next

        return dummy.next
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and space
