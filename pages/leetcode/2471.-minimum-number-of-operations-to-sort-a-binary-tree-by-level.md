# 2471. Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level

- https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-sort-a-binary-tree-by-level/

## Solution

1. Perform level-order traversal on the tree, starting from the root.
2. For each level, find length of all cycles in the array, and sum up the lengths

```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def swapOperationsRequiredToSort(arr):
            # find where the final indexes of each value should be in the array
            positions = {val: index for index, val in enumerate(sorted(arr))} 

            visited = [0] * len(arr)
            total = 0

            for i in range(len(arr)): # For each value in the array
                count = 0 # Keep track of the number of swaps required for this current element
                while not visited[i] and i != positions[arr[i]]: # While the current element is not sorted
                    visited[i] = 1 # Mark current element as visited
                    i = positions[arr[i]] # Go to the position where the current element should be (and continue from there)
                    count += 1 # Increase number of swaps required

                total += max(0, count - 1) # Update total number of swaps required (min 0)

            return total
        
        queue = deque([root])
        result = 0

        while len(queue) > 0: # Level-Order Traversal of tree
            arr = []
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                current = queue.popleft()
                arr.append(current.val)
                if current.left:
                    queue.append(current.left)

                if current.right:
                    queue.append(current.right)

            result += swapOperationsRequiredToSort(arr)

        return result
```

For a tree with $N$ nodes:
- Time complexity: $O(N \log N)$. For a full binary tree, BFS takes $O(N)$ time. For each level $i$, there are $2^i$ elements, and it would take $O(2^i \log 2^i)$ time to sort each level. There are $\log N$ levels in total. Hence, the overall time complexity is:

    $$
        T(N) = O \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{\log N} 2^i \log 2^i \right) = O \left( 2^{\log N} \log 2^{\log N} \right) = O(N \log N)
    $$
- Space complexity: $O(N)$. Values array stores at most $N / 2$ elements (last level of a full binary tree).
