# 3066. Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II

- https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-exceed-threshold-value-ii/description

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort() # Sort numbers from smallest to largest

        numberOfOperations = 0
        while True:
            num1 = heappop(nums) # Pop the smallest number
            if len(nums) == 0 or num1 >= k: # If there are no more numbers to pop, or the smallest number is >= k, we are done
                return numberOfOperations

            num2 = heappop(nums) # Pop the second smallest number

            heappush(nums, num1 * 2 + num2) # Push min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y) back into the array
            numberOfOperations += 1

        return -1
```

For a list `nums` of $N$ numbers:
- Time complexity: $O(N \log N)$. Sorting the numbers is $O(N \log N)$, and the pushing/popping from the heap takes $O(N \log N)$ as well (pushing/popping runs in $O(\log N)$ time, and we will do it $O(N)$ times).
- Space complexity: $O(N)$ to keep `nums` in memory.
