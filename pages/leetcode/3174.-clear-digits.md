# 3174. Clear Digits

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def clearDigits(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for c in s:
            if c.isdigit() and stack: # If it is a digit, and we have a non-digit on the left
                stack.pop() # Pop the non-digit 
            else:
                stack.append(c)

        return "".join(stack)
```

For a string `s` of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$ to iterate through all characters in `s`.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$ to maintain the stack, which will have at most all the characters of `s`.
