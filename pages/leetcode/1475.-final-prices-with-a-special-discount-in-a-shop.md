# 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop

- https://leetcode.com/problems/final-prices-with-a-special-discount-in-a-shop/

## Solution

This solution uses a monotonic stack, which is similar to [503. Next Greater Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/solutions/98270/JavaC++Python-Loop-Twice/)

1. Initialize the stack. This stack will represent products which we have not applied any discounts to. 
2. For each price in `prices`:
   1. If there is nothing in the stack, there is nothing to compare. Hence we have `len(stack) > 0` as part of the condition.
   2. `prices[stack[-1]]` refers to one of the previous prices we have seen. If one of the previous prices we have seen is greater than the current price we are looking at, then apply the discount, and pop the previous price out of the stack. We keep repeating until either the stack is empty, or the previous price we are looking at is less than the current price (no discount applied).
   3. Then we append the current price's index to the stack.
3. Return the modified `prices` array.

```py
class Solution:
    def finalPrices(self, prices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = [] # Initialize the stack

        for index, price in enumerate(prices): # For each price in prices
            # If a previous price is greater than or equal to the current price we are looking at
            while len(stack) > 0 and prices[stack[-1]] >= price: 
                prices[stack.pop()] -= price # Apply the discount to the previous price

            stack.append(index) # Append the current index to the stack

        return prices # Return the updated prices array
```

For a list of $N$ prices, 
- Time complexity: $O(N)$. Even though there is a nested `while` in the `for` loop, each element is at most pushed and popped from the stack once. There is no reinsertion of elements into the stack. Hence, it is only $O(N)$.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$. Worst case scenario occurs when the whole `prices` array is added to the stack
