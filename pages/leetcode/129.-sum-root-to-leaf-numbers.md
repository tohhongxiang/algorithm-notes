# 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

- https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/description/

## Solution

1. We define a recursive function `dfs(node, currentVal)`, where `node` is the current node we are looking at, and `currentVal` is the value we get tracing through the path from the root to the parent of `node`.
2. If `node` has no children (`node.left is None and node.right is None`), then we have reached the end of the tree, and can return the value, which is `10 * currentVal + node.val`.
3. If not, we check if there is a left node. If there is a left node, we recursively call `dfs` again, this time on the left node, and we have to update `currentVal` as well.
4. Repeat with the right node.
5. Return the sum of the left and the right.
6. The result would be the return value of `dfs(root, 0)`.

```py
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def dfs(node, currentVal):
            if node.left is None and node.right is None:
                return 10 * currentVal + node.val

            leftSum = 0
            if node.left is not None:
                leftSum = dfs(node.left, currentVal * 10 + node.val)

            rightSum = 0
            if node.right is not None:
                rightSum = dfs(node.right, currentVal * 10 + node.val)

            return leftSum + rightSum

        return dfs(root, 0)
```

For a binary tree with $N$ nodes:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$, since we have to go through all nodes.
- Space complexity: $O(\log N)$, the height of the recursive call stack would be at most the height of the tree, which is $O(\log N)$.
