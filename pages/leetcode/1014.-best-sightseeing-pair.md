# 1014. Best Sightseeing Pair

- https://leetcode.com/problems/best-sightseeing-pair/

## Solution

The score of a pair of sightseeing spots is `values[i] + values[j] + i - j`, where `i < j`. The main observation, for some index `j`, we keep track of the maximum value (`current_max`) before `j`. Everytime we increase `j`, we decrement `current_max` by 1.

1. We initialize `result = 0` as the final max score. This will be returned after we go through the entire `values` array.
2. We initialize `current_max = values[0] - 1`

```python
class Solution:
    def maxScoreSightseeingPair(self, values: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        current_max = values[0] - 1
        
        # Note: values[i] + current_max is the same as values[i] + values[j] + i - j
        for i in range(1, len(values)):
            result = max(result, values[i] + current_max)
            current_max = max(current_max - 1, values[i] - 1)

        return result
```

For a list of $N$ `values`:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$, iterating through each element in `values` once
- Space complexity: $O(1)$. No extra space was required.
