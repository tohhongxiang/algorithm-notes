Key notes:
- We would like to play the smallest tokens face up to lose the least amount of power and gain the most score
- We would like to play the largest tokens face down to increase by the most amount of power, and lose the least score

Hence, we should sort the tokens and use a two-pointer approach
1. Sort the tokens from smallest to largest, and have 2 pointers `l` and `r`. `l` will point to the smallest tokens, and `r` points at the largest tokens
2. While the pointers have not crossed each other, we check for 3 cases
   1. If we have enough power to play the smallest token face up `power >= tokens[l]`, then play this token face up
   2. If we do not have enough power to play the smallest token, but we have `score > 0` (the condition to play a token face down), then we play the largest token face down
   3. If neither condition is satisfied, we cannot do anything, and we break

```py
class Solution:
    def bagOfTokensScore(self, tokens: List[int], power: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        score = 0

        tokens.sort()

        l, r = 0, len(tokens) - 1

        while l <= r:
            if power >= tokens[l]:
                power -= tokens[l]
                l += 1
                score += 1
                result = max(result, score)
            elif score > 0:
                power += tokens[r]
                r -= 1
                score -= 1
            else:
                break

        return result
```

This runs in $O(n \log n)$ time and $O(1)$ space.
