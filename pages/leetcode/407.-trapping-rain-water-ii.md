```py
class Solution:
    def trapRainWater(self, heightMap: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS, COLS = len(heightMap), len(heightMap[0])

        min_heap = []
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if r in [0, ROWS - 1] or c in [0, COLS - 1]: # For borders
                    heappush(min_heap, (heightMap[r][c], r, c)) # Add (height, row, col) to min_heap
                    heightMap[r][c] = -1 # Mark as visited

        result = 0
        max_height = -1

        while len(min_heap) > 0:
            height, row, col = heappop(min_heap) # Get the cell with the lowest height
            max_height = max(max_height, height) # Update max height
            result += max_height - height # The amount of water that the current cell can hold

            neighbors = [[row + 1, col], [row - 1, col], [row, col + 1], [row, col - 1]]
            for neighbor_row, neighbor_col in neighbors:
                if neighbor_row < 0 or neighbor_col < 0 or neighbor_row == ROWS or neighbor_col == COLS or heightMap[neighbor_row][neighbor_col] == -1:
                    continue

                heappush(min_heap, (heightMap[neighbor_row][neighbor_col], neighbor_row, neighbor_col))
                heightMap[neighbor_row][neighbor_col] = -1 # Mark as visited

        return result      
```

For an $M$ by $N$ grid:
- Time complexity: $O(MN \log MN)$. We go through all $MN$ elements in the grid, and each `heappush`/`heappop` operation takes $\log MN$ time. `min_heap` will have at most $MN$ elements.
- Space complexity: $O(MN)$, the max size of `min_heap` is $MN$.
