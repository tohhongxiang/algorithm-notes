# 57. Insert Interval

- https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description

# Solution

1. Initialize a `result = []` which will be our final merged intervals, and `i = 0` the index of the interval we are currently looking at
2. Any interval that ends before the start of the new interval remains unaffected. Hence, we append it to `result`
3. We begin merging the intervals. While the start of the current interval is less than the end of the new interval, we merge the intervals together. This can be done using:

    ```py
    newInterval = [min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]), max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])]
    ```
4. After we are done merging the interval, we append it to the array
5. The remaining intervals are unaffected by the merge, so we append it to `result`

```py
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        i = 0

        # while the end of the previous interval is less than the start of the new interval
        # add as per normal
        while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]:
            result.append(intervals[i])
            i += 1

        # start of the interval is before the end of the new interval, we merge
        while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]:
            newInterval = [min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]), max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])]
            i += 1

        # after finding an interval that starts after the end of the new interval, we are done merging
        # append the merged interval to the result
        result.append(newInterval)

        # append the remaining intervals
        while i < len(intervals):
            result.append(intervals[i])
            i += 1

        return result
```

Runs in $O(n)$ time and space
