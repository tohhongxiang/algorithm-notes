# 206. Reverse Linked List

- https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description

# Solution

1. Initialize `prev = None` and `curr = head`. `curr` represents the current node, while `prev` represents the node before the current node
2. Keep track of the next node `nextNode = curr.next`. 
3. Set `curr.next = prev` to reverse the link of the current node
4. Update the previous node to the current node, and the current node to the next node: `prev = curr` and `curr = nextNode`
5. Repeat until the end of the list `curr is not None`


```py
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head

        while curr is not None:
            nextNode = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nextNode

        return prev
```
