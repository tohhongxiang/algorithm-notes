# 930. Binary Subarrays with Sum

- https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/description

# Solution

We define a helper function to find the number of subarrays whose sum is `<= x`. From there, our answer is simply `helper(goal) - helper(goal - 1)`

The algorithm for this helper:
1. Initialize a `result` for the number of subarrays whose sum is `<= x`. Initialize a left pointer `l` starting at the beginning of the array, and `cur` representing the sum of all elements in the sliding window
2. Whenever we increase `r`, we increase `cur` by `nums[r]`
3. If `cur > x`, then we need to shrink the window by increasing `l`
4. If `cur <= x`, then we add the length of the window to `result`, which is `r - l + 1`. Note how for each window of length `n`, there are `n` continuous subarrays that have a sum `<= x`

```py
class Solution:
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, nums: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
        # count num of subarrays where cursum <= x
        def helper(x):
            if x < 0:
                return 0

            result = 0
            l = 0
            cur = 0
            for r in range(len(nums)):
                cur += nums[r]

                while cur > x:
                    cur -= nums[l]
                    l += 1

                result += r - l  + 1

            return result

        return helper(goal) - helper(goal - 1)
```

This runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space
