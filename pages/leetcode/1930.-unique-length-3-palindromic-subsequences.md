## Solution

### Solution 1

```py
class Solution:
    def countPalindromicSubsequence(self, s: str) -> int:
        result = set() # Keep track of all palindromes we see

        left = set() # A set of all characters that appear on the left of `middle`
        right = Counter(s) # Frequency of characters occurring on the right side of `middle`

        for middle in s:
            right[middle] -= 1 # Remove middle character from `right`

            for character in left: # For each character we see on `left`
                if right[character] > 0: # If this character occurs on the right side
                    # Add the palindrome to `result`. Note we only have to add the middle and the end character to uniquely identify the palindrome
                    result.add(f"{middle}{character}") 

            left.add(middle) # Add the `middle` character to the `left` set

        return len(result) # Return the number of unique palindromes
```

For a string `s` of length $N$:
- Time complexity: $O(N)$. Note that the inner loop (`for character in left`) is $O(26) = O(1)$, because there are only 26 unique characters that can occur in `s`.
- Space complexity: $O(1)$. `left`, `right` and `result` are of $O(26) = O(1)$ space complexity.

### Solution 2

Observation: We can go through all possible characters. We check for the leftmost and rightmost occurrence of each character. All characters in between the leftmost occurrence and rightmost occurrence can form the palindrome.

```py
class Solution:
    def countPalindromicSubsequence(self, s: str) -> int:
        result = 0 # Number of palindromic subsequences
        for character in string.ascii_lowercase: # For every lower-case alphabetic character
            i, j = s.find(character), s.rfind(character) # Find the first and last occurrence of each character

            if i > -1: # If the character occurs in `s`
                result += len(set(s[i + 1:j])) # Every character in between can form a palindrome. Use `set` to count only unique palindromes

        return result
```
