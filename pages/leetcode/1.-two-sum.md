# 1. Two Sum

- https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum

## Solution

1. Initialize a `seen` dictionary which will keep track of the numbers we have seen, and the index (`{ [number]: index }`).
2. For each number in `nums`:
   1. If `target - nums[i]` is in the dictionary, means that we have found 2 numbers that sum to `target`. We can immediately return the result.
   2. If not, add the current number and its corresponding index into `seen`.
3. If we exit the loop, this means that there does not exist a pair of numbers that sum up to `target`, and we return `-1`.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Keep a dictionary of { [number]: index }
        seen = {}

        # Go through each number
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if target - nums[i] in seen: # If we have seen the other number
                return i, seen[target - nums[i]]

            seen[nums[i]] = i # Update dictionary

        return -1 # Not found
```

For a list of $N$ numbers,
- Time complexity: $O(N)$. We go through the entire array once, and each dictionary lookup is $O(1)$ time.
- Space complexity: $O(N)$. The worst case scenario is when we store the entire array into the dictionary.
